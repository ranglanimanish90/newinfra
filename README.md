🚀 **Automated Daily Engineering Status Reporting using GitHub Agentic Workflows**

`newinfra` demonstrates how **GitHub Agentic Workflows** can be used to automatically generate **daily engineering status reports** by reasoning over repository activity such as commits, pull requests, and issues.

The repository showcases a **hands-on implementation** of intent-driven automation using GitHub’s next-generation agentic capabilities.

---

## ✨ Overview

Engineering teams often spend valuable time manually preparing daily status updates. This project automates that process by leveraging:

- **GitHub Agentic Workflows**
- **GitHub Copilot–powered coding agents**
- **Repository signals as context**
- **AI-driven reasoning and summarization**

The result is a **consistent, contextual, and leadership-friendly daily status report**, generated automatically.

## 🧠 What Are Agentic Workflows?

Unlike traditional GitHub Actions that follow a fixed, step-by-step execution model, **Agentic Workflows** operate on *intent*:

- You define **what outcome you want**
- Agents decide **how to achieve it**
- Agents reason, filter noise, and generate meaningful output

In this repository, the intent is simple:

> _“Generate a meaningful daily engineering status report from recent repository activity.”_

## 📦 Key Features

- ✅ Automated daily status report generation
- ✅ Context-aware summarization (not just raw commits)
- ✅ Noise filtering for trivial changes
- ✅ Clean Markdown output
- ✅ Easy to extend for notifications or multi-repo reporting

---

## 📁 Use Cases
- Platform Engineering teams
- DevOps Centers of Excellence (CoE)
- Engineering leadership reporting
- Developer productivity initiatives

## 📌 Status
This repository represents an early adoption implementation of GitHub Agentic Workflows, intended to explore real-world automation and reporting use cases.
