# Terraform Security & Best Practices Agent

Perform a comprehensive security analysis of all Terraform code in the repository and generate a detailed security report as a GitHub issue.

## 🔍 Security Checks to Perform

### 1. **Secrets & Credentials Scanning**
Scan all `.tf` files for:
- Hardcoded AWS Access Keys (AKIA*, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
- Azure subscription IDs, client secrets, tenant IDs
- GCP service account keys
- API tokens, passwords, or connection strings
- Private keys or certificates
- Database credentials
- Any Base64-encoded secrets

**Flag with HIGH severity** if found, even if marked as "dummy" or "example".

### 2. **Network Security Issues**
Check for:
- Overly permissive CIDR blocks (`0.0.0.0/0` in security groups)
- Public IP addresses on sensitive resources
- Missing network ACLs or firewall rules
- Unencrypted network traffic (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- VPN/VNet configurations exposing internal services
- Missing private endpoints for PaaS services

### 3. **Encryption & Data Protection**
Verify that:
- Storage accounts have encryption at rest enabled
- Databases use TLS/SSL for connections
- Key vaults are properly configured
- Disk encryption is enabled for VMs
- Backup encryption is configured
- Customer-managed keys (CMK) are used where required

### 4. **Identity & Access Management**
Analyze:
- Overly permissive IAM/RBAC roles
- Missing principle of least privilege
- Service principals with Owner/Contributor roles
- Shared access signatures (SAS) with long expiration
- Missing managed identities where applicable
- Wildcard permissions in policies

### 5. **Compliance & Configuration**
Check for:
- Missing required tags (environment, owner, cost-center, compliance)
- Resources without proper naming conventions
- Soft delete not enabled on critical resources
- Audit logging disabled
- Public network access enabled unnecessarily
- Missing resource locks on production resources

### 6. **Terraform Best Practices**
Validate:
- Module versions are pinned (not using `latest`)
- Backend configuration is secure (no hardcoded values)
- Variables have proper descriptions and validation
- Outputs don't expose sensitive values
- State file encryption is configured
- `.terraform.lock.hcl` is committed

### 7. **Cost Analysis & Optimization**
Analyze and estimate for serverless architecture:

- **Serverless Compute Costs**: Lambda/Azure Functions, execution time & memory
  - Total number of invocations per month
  - Average execution duration and memory allocation
  - Cold start optimization opportunities
  - Overprovisioned memory configurations (128MB vs 512MB impact)
  - ARM vs x86 architecture cost savings (AWS Lambda)
  
- **Message Queue Costs**: SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus, Event Grid
  - Number of messages per month (requests)
  - Message size and data transfer implications
  - Standard vs FIFO queues cost difference (SQS)
  - Dead letter queue storage costs
  - SNS topic publish operations and subscriptions
  - Event Grid publish operations and event delivery costs
  
- **API & Gateway Costs**: API Gateway, Azure API Management, Azure Front Door
  - Number of API requests per month
  - REST vs HTTP API cost difference (AWS)
  - WebSocket connections if applicable
  - Caching enabled/disabled impact
  - Request/response payload sizes
  
- **Storage Costs**: S3, Azure Blob Storage, DynamoDB, Cosmos DB
  - Storage tier usage (Hot, Cool, Archive, Intelligent Tiering)
  - Request costs (GET, PUT, LIST operations)
  - Data retrieval costs from Cool/Archive tiers
  - DynamoDB read/write capacity units (provisioned vs on-demand)
  - Storage redundancy levels (LRS vs GRS)
  
- **Database & State Management**: DynamoDB, Cosmos DB, Table Storage
  - Provisioned vs on-demand capacity mode
  - Read/Write capacity units and auto-scaling
  - Global tables/replication costs
  - Backup and restore costs
  
- **Orchestration Costs**: Step Functions, Logic Apps, EventBridge
  - Number of state transitions (Step Functions)
  - Logic Apps action executions
  - EventBridge custom bus and rule evaluations
  
- **Observability Costs**: CloudWatch, Application Insights, Log Analytics
  - Logs ingestion volume (GB/month)
  - Metrics and custom metrics count
  - Log retention periods
  - Query/analytics costs
  - Distributed tracing costs (X-Ray, App Insights)
  
- **Data Transfer Costs**: Inter-service, inter-region, internet egress
  - Data transfer between availability zones
  - Cross-region data transfer
  - Data transfer to internet
  - VPC/VNet peering costs
  - NAT Gateway data processing
  
- **Key Vault & Secrets Management**: Key Vault operations, Secrets Manager
  - Number of secret retrievals per month
  - Standard vs Premium tier (HSM-backed keys)
  - Rotation operations
  - Parameter Store vs Secrets Manager (AWS)

**Serverless Cost Optimization Opportunities**:
- Functions with excessive memory allocation (right-sizing)
- Dead code or rarely invoked functions (clean up)
- Missing reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- Inefficient polling patterns (consider event-driven)
- Long-running functions that could be split
- Missing SQS batch processing (reduce invocations)
- CloudWatch logs without retention policies (unlimited storage)
- Missing S3 lifecycle policies
- DynamoDB tables without auto-scaling
- Development/staging using same tier as production

**Provide Monthly Cost Estimate**:
- Calculate estimated monthly cost for each service category
- Show cost per million invocations/requests
- Identify top 5 most expensive services
- Estimate data transfer costs between services
- Suggest cost savings opportunities with potential savings amount
- Flag unusual usage patterns that could cause cost spikes
